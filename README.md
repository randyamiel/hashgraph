# hashgraph
hashgraph blockchain that uses gossip-of-gossip validation algorithm instead of a proof-of-work methodology like bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. This is intended to be a public ledger specifically for banking applications but we will try to write it in the most usable fashion for any technology to sit on top of it.
